              <h2>The QiPao</h2>
              <p>
              An everyday staple in the wardrobes of Chinese women from the 1920s to the 1960s, the Qipao is an embodiment of the timeless elegance and versatility integral to oriental femininity.

              <h2>The History</h2>
              <p>
             The origins of the qipao, also known as cheongsam, can be traced to the turn of the 20th century, against the backdrop of political and social upheaval in China. The qipao has its roots in the long robes worn by Manchu women during the Qing Dynasty (1644 – 1912). It later evolved into the iconic figure-hugging dress characterized by a side slit and a high cylindrical collar which we know today. A symbol of liberation and sensuality, the qipao shapes and has been shaped by the shifting silhouettes of Chinese society through the tides of time.

              <h2>The Modern Resurgence</h2>
              <p>
             With films like In The Mood For Love (2000) and Lust, Caution (2007) garnering international acclaim, a yearning for nostalgia precipitated demand for the cheongsam again. A new generation of younger female consumers is no longer seeing the qipao as a relic from their grandmothers’ wardrobes. Instead, it is increasingly viewed as a timeless heritage piece that could be reinvented with a modern-day fashion sense. This has given rise to innovative designs such as mandarin-collared jumpsuits and midi length qipaos suitable for all formal and informal occasions. Adding a modern twist to a traditional dress does not only reflect the creativity of contemporary dressmakers. It is also indicative of the versatility of the qipao and its quintessential elements that have stood the test of time.
